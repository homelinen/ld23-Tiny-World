#Tiny World

Created by Dan Bell and [Calum Gilchrist](http://calumgilchrist.com)

##Entry for Ludum Dare Jam 23.

###About

This is the version released for Ludum Dare. This was the final product after
72 hours.

###Gameplay

The idea was to start as a tiny planet and build up your mass by collecting other celestial bodies, but we never finished scaling, so we have a sort of asteroid catching game.

There is no concrete objective. Asteroids (grey) detract from your atmosphere, but add more mass and Comets (blue) add to atmosphere and a little bit of mass.

Also, being close to the sun reduces your atmosphere.

###Controls
WASD to move, space to stop

### Issue List

* Exit in Menu doesn't work
* Player not centered
* Hitbox slightly off for player
* Player is as fast as every other object
* Player can collide with sun.
